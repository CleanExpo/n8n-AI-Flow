# n8n AI Flow - Build Completion Action Plan

## Current Status Summary
✅ **Completed:**
- Next.js 14 application structure with TypeScript
- Supabase authentication with GitHub OAuth
- Basic workflow builder UI
- Sophisticated AI orchestrator system
- MCP servers installed (filesystem, memory, wsl-deployment, context7, playwright)

❌ **Missing Critical Components:**
- Database schema and persistence
- Real n8n integration
- API endpoints for workflow operations
- Advanced UI features (drag-and-drop, node connections)
- Workflow execution engine

## Phase 1: Database Foundation (Priority: HIGH)
### 1.1 Create Supabase Schema
```sql
-- Tables needed:
- workflows (id, user_id, name, description, config, created_at, updated_at)
- nodes (id, workflow_id, type, position, config, connections)
- executions (id, workflow_id, status, started_at, completed_at, result)
- workflow_templates (id, name, category, config, is_public)
```

### 1.2 Implement Data Models
- [ ] Create TypeScript interfaces for all entities
- [ ] Build Supabase client service layer
- [ ] Add CRUD operations for workflows
- [ ] Implement real-time subscriptions for execution status

## Phase 2: n8n Integration (Priority: HIGH)
### 2.1 n8n Server Connection
- [ ] Set up n8n instance (Docker or cloud)
- [ ] Create n8n API client wrapper
- [ ] Implement workflow sync between UI and n8n
- [ ] Add webhook endpoint handling

### 2.2 Workflow Execution Engine
- [ ] Create execution service connecting to n8n
- [ ] Implement workflow trigger mechanisms
- [ ] Add execution monitoring and logging
- [ ] Build error handling and retry logic

## Phase 3: API Development (Priority: HIGH)
### 3.1 RESTful API Endpoints
```
POST   /api/workflows        - Create workflow
GET    /api/workflows        - List workflows
GET    /api/workflows/:id    - Get workflow details
PUT    /api/workflows/:id    - Update workflow
DELETE /api/workflows/:id    - Delete workflow
POST   /api/workflows/:id/execute - Execute workflow
GET    /api/executions       - List executions
```

### 3.2 WebSocket for Real-time Updates
- [ ] Implement Socket.io or native WebSockets
- [ ] Stream execution logs
- [ ] Real-time node status updates
- [ ] Collaborative editing support

## Phase 4: Advanced UI Components (Priority: MEDIUM)
### 4.1 Workflow Canvas Enhancements
- [ ] Implement react-flow or similar library for node graph
- [ ] Add drag-and-drop node placement
- [ ] Create visual connection drawing between nodes
- [ ] Implement zoom/pan controls
- [ ] Add minimap for large workflows

### 4.2 Node Configuration
- [ ] Build dynamic configuration forms per node type
- [ ] Add validation for node inputs
- [ ] Implement expression editor with syntax highlighting
- [ ] Create variable picker interface

### 4.3 Workflow Management
- [ ] Add workflow templates gallery
- [ ] Implement import/export functionality
- [ ] Create workflow versioning system
- [ ] Build workflow sharing mechanism

## Phase 5: AI Integration Enhancement (Priority: MEDIUM)
### 5.1 AI Agent Improvements
- [ ] Connect orchestrator to actual AI services
- [ ] Implement prompt management system
- [ ] Add AI model selection (GPT-4, Claude, etc.)
- [ ] Create AI-powered workflow suggestions

### 5.2 Natural Language Processing
- [ ] Build natural language to workflow converter
- [ ] Implement workflow explanation generator
- [ ] Add AI-assisted debugging

## Phase 6: Testing & Quality (Priority: MEDIUM)
### 6.1 Testing Framework
- [ ] Set up Jest for unit tests
- [ ] Add Playwright for E2E tests
- [ ] Implement API testing with Supertest
- [ ] Create test data factories

### 6.2 Code Quality
- [ ] Set up ESLint rules
- [ ] Add Prettier configuration
- [ ] Implement pre-commit hooks
- [ ] Add GitHub Actions CI/CD

## Phase 7: Production Readiness (Priority: LOW)
### 7.1 Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement caching strategy
- [ ] Add rate limiting
- [ ] Optimize database queries
- [ ] Set up CDN for static assets

### 7.2 Security
- [ ] Implement RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
- [ ] Add API key management
- [ ] Set up audit logging
- [ ] Implement data encryption

### 7.3 Deployment
- [ ] Configure Docker containers
- [ ] Set up Kubernetes manifests
- [ ] Create environment configurations
- [ ] Implement monitoring and alerting

## Quick Wins (Can be done immediately)
1. **Database Schema Creation** - Run SQL migrations in Supabase
2. **Basic API Routes** - Create CRUD endpoints for workflows
3. **Improve Node Canvas** - Add react-flow for better visualization
4. **Connect AI Orchestrator** - Wire up to OpenAI/Claude APIs
5. **Add Workflow Persistence** - Save/load workflows from database

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Start with Phase 1 (Database) - Essential for all other features
2. Implement basic API endpoints (Phase 3.1)
3. Enhance UI with react-flow (Phase 4.1)
4. Connect to n8n server (Phase 2.1)
5. Add execution capabilities (Phase 2.2)

## Technologies to Add
- **react-flow** - For workflow canvas
- **Socket.io** - For real-time updates
- **Zod** - For schema validation
- **React Query/SWR** - For data fetching
- **React Hook Form** - For node configuration
- **Monaco Editor** - For code/expression editing

## Estimated Timeline
- Phase 1-2: 2-3 weeks
- Phase 3-4: 2-3 weeks
- Phase 5-6: 2 weeks
- Phase 7: 1-2 weeks
- **Total: 7-10 weeks for full completion**

## Resource Requirements
- n8n server instance (Docker or cloud)
- Supabase project with proper tables
- API keys for AI services (OpenAI, Claude)
- Testing environment setup
- Production hosting (Vercel, AWS, etc.)
