Trigger deployment to apply Project Settings configuration - Wed, Sep 10, 2025  6:30:15 PM

Fixed configuration mismatch on main branch:
- Production Overrides used .next as Output Directory 
- Project Settings use Next.js default (automatic detection)
- This deployment should resolve the "No Next.js version detected" error

Switched from master to main branch per user request.
